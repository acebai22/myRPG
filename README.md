Originally this was a game created from a course on freecodecamp.com
I added a few things of my own to make the game more fun.

Improvements:
*increased game window size
*added possibility of weapon break during easteregg game
*changed background to red on death
*Made inventory constantly visible
*Changed monster stats background color depending on monster.
*updated visuals with a new font/color scheme
*"click" buttons by pressing 1, 2, & 3 keys without having to click the mouse.
*constantly checks for player death. Formerly only checked when particular functions were run. After my additions, I found that it would be best if the code constantly checked if health had hit 0.
*save function added, stores health, xp, and gold.
*load function added, restores health, xp, and gold.
*add photos of beasts we're fighting.

To come:
*Replace inventory text with images of weapons.
*Make weapons inventory save when the save button is clicked.
